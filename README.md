# USF Microcredential Prompt Library

This repository contains standardized, evidence-based prompts for generating
audit-defensible microcredential metadata.

These prompts are designed to support:

- Employer credibility
- Compliance and review readiness
- Non-fabrication standards
- Scalable credential operations

They prioritize accuracy, traceability, and honest representation over inflated claims.

## Purpose

Many digital credentials fail due to vague descriptions, invented rigor,
or unsupported learning claims.

This library provides governance-focused prompt templates that transform
course materials into achievement-based credential metadata without
exaggeration or misrepresentation.
